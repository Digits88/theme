			<p><strong>So we did.</strong></p>

			<p>We dreamed of an easy-to-use affiliate marketing solution that looked and felt like WordPress. We yearned for a platform that put the utmost importance on reliable tracking and accurate data. And we longed for a system that delivered the features needed to make setting up an affiliate program ridiculously simple.</p>

			<p>Fed-up with frustrating experiences using other unreliable systems already in the market, we wanted an affiliate system that we <em>loved</em> to use.</p>

			<p>And so, AffiliateWP was born.</p>

			<p>With AffiliateWP, you get an easy-to-use, reliable WordPress plugin that gives you the affiliate marketing tools you need to grow your business and make more money. It’s designed to help you easily set up and run a successful affiliate program. AffiliateWP takes the hassle out of affiliate marketing so you can spend time focusing on what is most important &mdash; running your business.</p>

			<p>AffiliateWP is our dream realized. Our customers love using AffiliateWP, we love using AffiliateWP, and we know you’ll love using it too.</p>

			<h1 class="center-xs">Our story</h1>

			<p>In late 2010, Pippin Williamson was beginning to build his plugin development resource at <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com" target="_blank">PippinsPlugins.com</a>. Pippin needed a membership framework that allowed him to provide this content to members only, so he created <a href="https://restrictcontentpro.com" target="_blank">Restrict Content Pro</a> - a simple yet powerful membership plugin for WordPress. Soon after that, it became apparent that an eCommerce platform was needed to sell the plugins that Pippin was building, leading to the development of <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com" target="_blank">Easy Digital Downloads</a>.</p>

			<p>After Easy Digital Downloads and Restrict Content Pro became prominent players in the eCommerce and membership spaces, a consistent trend arose: both Pippin and his customers were looking for a high-quality affiliate management system to help them grow their businesses. With that realization, the next plugin project became obvious; it was time to venture into the world of Affiliate Marketing.</p>

			<p>AffiliateWP was founded in early 2014 with an aim to provide a top-notch, self-hosted, and intuitive affiliate management system for WordPress. And we’re not done yet! We are constantly working to bring you a more robust affiliate marketing offering with consistent updates, new features and new add-ons.</p>

			<p>We’re immensely proud of AffiliateWP, and we can’t wait to hear how AffiliateWP helps you build a successful affiliate program and grow your business.</p>

			<p>Oh, and meet Alf, our cheeky, friendly leader!</p>

						<p>Drew Jaynes is a WordPress core developer, docs enthusiast, and plugin developer who hails from Arvada, Colorado. Drew has been developing with WordPress since 2008, initially contracting at a university and later working as a developer for an elite WordPress agency before joining the team at AffiliateWP.</p>

		                <p>Drew's contributions to WordPress are vast and have spanned the core, docs, meta, support, and community teams to name a few.

		                <p>In his spare time – other than doing WordPress when he's taking a break from WordPress – Drew likes to travel by plane, train, or automobile just about anywhere, but more often than not it's to the nearby Rocky Mountains for a variety of outdoor activities.

						<p>After working from a cubicle slinging T-SQL and .NET for over a decade, and a short stint with iOS app support, Ginger broke into the WordPress world in late 2013 while looking for help on a real estate website. Before development her background included telephone support at a C:\ prompt, email support and QA. Ginger became part of the AffiliateWP team in early 2017, tackling support tickets, testing code changes and of course participating in various Slack shenanigans</p>

		                <p>Ginger called Texas her home for many decades and speaks fluent Texan still to this day. (Y'all is a word) However, after many visits the call of the Pacific and West Coast vibe was too strong to ignore, and she now hails from the state park otherwise known as Portland, Oregon. Screen breaks for Ginger include walking their Chow/Akita mix Zivah as often as possible, drinking fabulous mocha coffee creations and exploring foodie and oceanic hiking adventures with her husband Jeff.</p>
