		<p>In late 2010, Pippin was beginning to build his plugin development resource at https://pippinsplugins.com. Out of this was born Restrict Content Pro to make running a membership website easy. Soon after that, it became apparent that an eCommerce platform was needed to sell the plugins that Pippin was building, leading to the development of Easy Digital Downloads.</p>

		<p>After Easy Digital Downloads and Restrict Content Pro became prominent players in the eCommerce and membership space, a consistent trend became apparent. Our customers needed a high quality option for running affiliate programs to help them build their own businesses. With that realization, the choice of where to go next was obvious.</p>

		<p>AffiliateWP was founded in early 2014 in an effort to provide a top-notch, self-hosted, and intuitive affiliate management system for WordPress.</p>

		<p>Today AffiliateWP is an easy-to-use, reliable WordPress plugin that gives you the affiliate marketing tools you need to grow your business and make more money.</p>

						<p>Drew Jaynes is a WordPress core developer, docs enthusiast, and plugin developer who hails from Arvada, Colorado.
