			          <p>Honestly, I'm super picky about what plugins I'll run on my sites. I've wanted to set up an affiliate program for a while, but all of the plugins I tried were buggy, overloaded with options, and difficult to use. When I heard Pippin was going to build one, I couldn't wait to try it. </p><p>Now that I've used it, I can honestly say that he's completely outdone himself. AffiliateWP is by far the most well-coded and easiest-to-use affiliate management plugin ever made for WordPress. There's no crazy setup or clunky dashboard to deal with.</p> <p>Everything works exactly like it should; just like core WordPress features. You literally install AffiliateWP, pick an option or two, and within a few minutes you've got a fully-functioning affiliate program. It doesn't get much better than that.</p>

				          <p>Affiliates can have a huge impact on sales, but the solutions out there are clunky. I wanted something self hosted, well written, and built on WordPressâ€™ foundation. Coming from something dated, slow, and unstable: AffiliateWP is a breath of fresh air.</p>

				          <p>I spend all day in my WordPress dashboard so I wanted, nay, needed an affiliate solution that integrated flawlessly with WordPress. AffiliateWP was set up in minutes, is completely accurate, and helps me grow my business. It doesn't hurt that it's built by people you can trust either.</p>

				          <p>AffiliateWP is hands-down the easiest affiliate system I have ever seen or worked with. With just a few clicks I had it installed and configured to my specific needs. The only thing easier than actually using this plugin was the decision to buy it. How can you say 'no' to something that was built by two of the most respected developers in the community and has a 100% refund policy?</p>
